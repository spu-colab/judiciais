Subject of the issue - https://github.com/tymondesigns/jwt-auth/issues/1787

Got error on 'jwt.auth' & jwt.refresh' middlewares
"message": "Call to undefined method Illuminate\Events\Dispatcher::fire()",

According to https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/upgrade#events
The fire method (which was deprecated in Laravel 5.4) of the Illuminate/Events/Dispatcher class has been removed. You should use the dispatch method instead.

I moved middleware and did some changes
GetUserFromToken:

    $this->events->fire('tymon.jwt.valid', $user);
    -> $this->events->dispatch('tymon.jwt.valid', $user);

BaseMiddleware:

    $response = $this->events->fire($event, $payload, true);
    -> $response = $this->events->dispatch($event, $payload, true);
